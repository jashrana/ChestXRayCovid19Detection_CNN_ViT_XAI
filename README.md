**Radiology Image Classification for Early Detection of COVID-19 Pneumonia in Patients**

A project (part of my thesis at the University of Galway - MSc Artificial Intelligence) demonstrating Deep Learning techniques like CNN, CNN with SVM and Vision Transformer along with eXplainable AI as a part of the model, to make a human decision support system.
